Demonstrates adding an SKLabelNode to a tapped ARAnchor in an SKScene with the current top result from a classification MLModel.

### TODO:

- [ ] Make video source selectable
- [ ] Add face tracking
- [ ] Experiment with [various models](https://github.com/likedan/Awesome-CoreML-Models)
- [ ] Add more interesting nodes than plain labels!
